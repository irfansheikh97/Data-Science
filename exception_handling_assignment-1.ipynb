    "1.What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "--**Exception in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event that can disrupt the normal flow of a program. It is a signal that something unexpected or erroneous has happened during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, Python generates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as the type of exception and a description of the problem. Exception handling allows you to gracefully respond to and recover from these unexpected events, preventing your program from crashing or producing incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common types of exceptions in Python include `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and many others. You can also create custom exceptions to handle specific error conditions in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nature of Error:**\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a Python program. They are typically caused by invalid or unexpected input data or unexpected conditions during program execution.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing of the code before it is executed. They are caused by violations of the Python language's syntax rules, such as missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detection:**\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions are detected during the execution of the program. They may occur in response to specific conditions or input data.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter while parsing the code before any execution occurs. These errors prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling:**\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to specify how the program should respond to the error. You can catch exceptions, log the error, and continue program execution.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Syntax errors cannot be handled using try-except blocks because they prevent the program from running. You must fix these errors in the code to make it syntactically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Examples:**\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Examples of exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError` (division by zero), `TypeError` (e.g., trying to concatenate a string and an integer), and `FileNotFoundError` (trying to open a non-existent file).\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Examples of syntax errors include missing colons in loops or function definitions, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution and can be handled, while syntax errors are detected during code parsing, preventing the program from running until they are fixed. Handling exceptions allows for graceful error recovery and the continuation of program execution in the presence of unexpected errors."
