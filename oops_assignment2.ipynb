    "\"\"\"Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental principles in object-oriented programming (OOP), and they serve related but distinct purposes. Let's differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation and provide examples for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition:** Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling them using high-level entities (classes and objects) that capture essential attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on providing a high-level view of an entity or concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of abstraction is to reduce complexity and make it easier to understand and work with a complex system. It allows developers to create models of real-world entities or concepts in a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:** Consider a `Shape` class that represents geometric shapes. Shapes have common attributes like color and area, as well as behaviors like calculating area. By abstracting the concept of a shape, we can create subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit the common attributes and behaviors, while each shape type hides its specific implementation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        pass  # Abstract method\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, length, width):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.width\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape` class abstracts the concept of a geometric shape, focusing on common attributes like `color` and a behavior to calculate the area. Subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle` inherit and implement their specific details while maintaining a high-level abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It enforces a clear separation between the internal implementation of a class and how it's used by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of encapsulation is to provide data hiding and access control. It restricts direct access to an object's internal data and ensures that data is accessed and modified through well-defined methods, which allows for better control and maintenance of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:** Consider a `Person` class that encapsulates personal information such as name, age, and email. Access to and modification of these attributes are controlled through getter and setter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, email):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Encapsulation: Private attribute with double underscores\n",
    "        self.__age = age\n",
    "        self.__email = email\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
    "        if age >= 0:\n",
    "            self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_email(self):\n",
    "        return self.__email\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_email(self, email):\n",
    "        if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "            self.__email = email\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Person object\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing and modifying attributes through getter and setter methods\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Output: Alice\n",
    "person.set_age(31)\n",
    "print(person.get_age())   # Output: 31\n",
    "person.set_email(\"newemail@example.com\")\n",
    "print(person.get_email())  # Output: newemail@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, encapsulation is achieved by marking the attributes as private (using double underscores) and providing getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes. This ensures data integrity and control over attribute access. Clients of the `Person` class interact with the object through these methods, preserving encapsulation.\"\"\""

    "\"\"\"What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module in the Python Standard Library that provides tools for defining and working with abstract base classes and abstract methods. Abstract base classes (ABCs) are a way to implement abstraction in Python, allowing you to define interfaces and enforce method signatures in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the `abc` module is used and its key purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Abstract Base Classes:** The `abc` module allows you to define abstract base classes using the `ABC` metaclass. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. It typically contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforcing Method Signatures:** With the `@abstractmethod` decorator provided by the `abc` module, you can declare abstract methods in your base classes. Abstract methods are methods without an implementation in the base class. Subclasses that inherit from the abstract base class are required to implement these abstract methods, ensuring that they adhere to a specific interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Providing a Common Interface:** Abstract base classes help define a common interface for a group of related classes. This makes it easier to work with objects of different classes that share a similar set of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of using the `abc` module to create an abstract base class with an abstract method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.width\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define an abstract base class `Shape` using the `ABC` metaclass.\n",
    "- `Shape` declares an abstract method `area()`.\n",
    "- Concrete subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` inherit from `Shape` and provide implementations for the `area()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module ensures that any attempt to create an instance of `Shape` or its subclasses without implementing the `area()` method results in a `TypeError`. This enforces adherence to the common interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `abc` module in Python is used to define abstract base classes and abstract methods, helping to establish a common interface and enforce method signatures in derived classes, promoting code consistency and ensuring that classes adhere to a predefined contract.\"\"\""

    "\"\"\"How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the concept of simplifying complex data by hiding unnecessary details while exposing essential information. It allows you to work with data at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on what data represents rather than how it is implemented. In Python, you can achieve data abstraction through various mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** OOP is a powerful paradigm for achieving data abstraction. You can use classes and objects to encapsulate data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. By defining classes with well-defined interfaces, you provide a way to interact with data without exposing its internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "           self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "       def introduce(self):\n",
    "           return f\"My name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `Person` class abstracts the concept of a person's name and age. Users of the class can interact with `Person` objects without needing to know how the attributes are stored or how the `introduce()` method works.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Properties and Getter/Setter Methods:** You can use properties and getter/setter methods to control access to data attributes. This allows you to enforce data abstraction by providing controlled access to the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Rectangle:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
    "           self._length = length  # Private attribute\n",
    "           self._width = width    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "       @property\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           return self._length * self._width\n",
    "\n",
    "       @property\n",
    "       def perimeter(self):\n",
    "           return 2 * (self._length + self._width)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `_length` and `_width` are private attributes, and properties (`area` and `perimeter`) are used to abstract access to these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modules and Packages:** Python's module system allows you to encapsulate and abstract data by organizing it into separate modules and packages. You can control the visibility of data and functions within a module, exposing only what's necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # math_operations.py module\n",
    "   def add(x, y):\n",
    "       return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "   def subtract(x, y):\n",
    "       return x - y\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Users of the `math_operations` module can import and use the functions without needing to know their implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Data Structures:** You can create custom data structures with well-defined interfaces and encapsulated internal data. By defining methods to interact with the data structure, you abstract the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Stack:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.items = []\n",
    "\n",
    "       def push(self, item):\n",
    "           self.items.append(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "       def pop(self):\n",
    "           if not self.is_empty():\n",
    "               return self.items.pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "       def is_empty(self):\n",
    "           return len(self.items) == 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Users of the `Stack` class can push and pop items without needing to know the details of how the stack is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is a crucial concept in software design and development as it promotes code modularity, reusability, and maintainability while hiding implementation details to prevent unintended side effects and errors.\"\"\""
