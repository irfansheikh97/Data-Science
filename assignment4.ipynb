You can use assignments, loops, and conditional statements in an imperative style.\\n\\nProcedural: Python supports procedural programming, where you can organize your code into functions and procedures. It encourages breaking down a program into smaller, reusable functions.\\n\\nObject-Oriented: Python is a fully object-oriented programming language. You can define classes and create objects, encapsulating data and behavior into objects. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are fundamental principles of Python's object-oriented programming.\\n\\nFunctional: Python supports functional programming concepts. You can use functions as first-class objects, pass functions as arguments, and return functions from other functions. Python provides built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() for functional-style programming.\\n\\nScripting: Python is often used as a scripting language for automating tasks, system administration, and rapid prototyping. Its concise and readable syntax makes it well-suited for scripting.\\n\\nDynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type of a variable explicitly.
