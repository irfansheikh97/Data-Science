Classes provide a way to encapsulate data and functionality into a single unit, promoting code reusability and maintainability.\n",

    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts access to some of the object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data. In OOP, you can achieve encapsulation through access modifiers like public, private, and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and behaviors from the superclass. It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes. Subclasses can extend or override the inherited methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a consistent way. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces (in languages like Java) or function overloading (in languages like C++).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, abstraction involves defining classes and objects that represent real-world entities, focusing on essential attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It helps in modeling complex systems and managing their complexity.\"\"\"\n"

    "\"\"\"Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the `__init__()` function, also known as a constructor, is used to initialize the attributes (properties) of an object when it is created from a class. It is one of the special methods in Python and other OOP languages and is automatically called when an object is instantiated from a class. The primary purpose of the `__init__()` function is to set the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",

It is used to refer to the instance (object) itself within the class. The self parameter is a reference to the current object, and it allows you to access and modify the object's attributes and call its methods.\"\"\""

    "\"\"\"What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The new subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass, promoting code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance:** In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass. This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance:** In multiple inheritance, a subclass can inherit from multiple superclasses. This allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from more than one source.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Flyable:\n",
    "       def fly(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Swimmer:\n",
    "       def swim(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Duck(Flyable, Swimmer):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** In multilevel inheritance, a subclass inherits from a superclass, and then another subclass inherits from that subclass, forming a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Mammal(Animal):\n",
    "       def give_birth(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Mammal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance:** Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can involve a mix of any of the above types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class A:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class B(A):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class C:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class D(B, C):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, you can see different forms of inheritance, each serving different purposes. Inheritance allows you to model relationships between classes, reuse code, and create a well-organized and modular codebase.\"\"\""
